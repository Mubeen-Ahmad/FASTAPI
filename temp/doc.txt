Detox was a project by Google, in collaboration with the Wikimedia Foundation, to research methods that could be used to address users posting unkind comments in Wikimedia community discussions.
Among other parts of the Detox project, the Wikimedia Foundation and Jigsaw collaborated to use artificial intelligence for basic research and to develop technical solutions[example needed] to address the problem. 
In October 2016 those organizations published "Ex Machina: Personal Attacks Seen at Scale" describing their findings.[8][9] Various popular media outlets reported on the publication of this paper and described the social context of the research.
