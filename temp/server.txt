ExploitForum: Paid registration only. It's a good place to market your tools. The admin is a good friend of mine. If you have done some notable projects, share them with me, and I will approve your account for free.

Breachforums: A forum where you can find leaked databases. The forum was recently seized and reappeared, so it might be a honeypot controlled by the FBI and cops.

Dread Forum: A forum with good OPSEC guides, focusing on dark web marketplaces and vendors. It's often referred to as the Reddit of the dark web.
